# 👋 Hi, I'm Mike

I'm a **pragmatic** and **curious software engineer** with a background in **Computer Science and Engineering**.  
I enjoy designing and building systems that are not only effective, but also **elegant**, **maintainable**, and **scalable**.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of **AI 🤖**, **data infrastructure 🗄️**, and **distributed systems 🌍** — whether it's a **recommendation engine**, a **nutritional planner based on combinatorial optimization**, or a **database management system**.

What drives me is **solving hard problems with clear reasoning**, and **shipping things that bring real value to users**.

I ❤️ to **own the projects** I'm working on and I strive to **continuously learn** whatever can help me solve the user problem in the most efficient and effective way.

### 🛠️ What I Like Working On

- 🤖 **Applied AI/ML** and recommendation systems  
- 🧱 **System architecture** and backend design  
- 🔢 **Optimization and modeling** problems (combinatorial and heuristics 😉)  
- ☁️ **Scalable data pipelines** and cloud infrastructure  
- 🧑‍💻 **Full-stack engineering** with strong product ownership  

### 📦 Featured Projects
